# NFL_in_R
This project leverages the R language to clean and analyze a dataset containing NFL game data. Ultimately statistical tests are run to contrast stadium types and game outcome.

My graduate program in Data Science will enable me to revisit my repository regarding the "NFL Survivor" game. This project in particular will incorporate R to test relationships between environmental factors (tested with indoor vs outdoor stadiums and turf vs. grass stadiums) in NFL games from 2000-2021. My hope is to come back to the data later to make a comprehensive program which can predict out odds for the entire NFL season (which sportsbooks avoid), and then create an ideal "path" through the season.
