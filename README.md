# NFL_in_R
To piggieback off of work that I already started, this is a complementary project that takes NFL data and starts to do analysis on it. It's also been a helpful way to introduce R into my growing list of languages.

My prior project lost steam because I lacked the statistical and analytical skills to make the next jump. I have since started a Grad program in Data Science which should start to address these inadequacies. This project in particular will incorporate R to test relationships between environmental factors (tested with indoor vs outdoor stadiums and turf vs. grass stadiums) in NFL games from 2000-2021. My hope is to come back to the data later to make a comprehensive program which can predict out odds for the entire NFL season (which sportsbooks avoid), and then create an "ideal" path through the season.
